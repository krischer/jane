Once Anaconda is installed, the following can be\nused to setup a new dedicated and separate environment to run \nJane\n:\n\n\n$ conda config --add channels obspy\n$ conda create -n jane python=3.4\n$ source activate jane\n(jane)$ conda install obspy psycopg2 markdown flake8 gdal pyyaml pip\n# Install the latest 1.9.x release.\n(jane)$ pip install \ndjango\n=1.9,\n1.10\n\n(jane)$ pip install djangorestframework djangorestframework-gis djangorestframework-jsonp djangorestframework-xml djangorestframework-yaml django-cors-headers django-debug-toolbar django-plugins defusedxml geojson markdown mkdocs mkdocs-bootswatch\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, the following Anaconda environment description file ...\n\n\nname: jane\ndependencies:\n- python=3.4\n- obspy\n- psycopg2\n- markdown\n- flake8\n- gdal\n- pyyaml\n- pip\n- pip:\n  - django\n=1.9,\n1.10\n  - djangorestframework\n  - djangorestframework-gis\n  - djangorestframework-jsonp\n  - djangorestframework-xml\n  - djangorestframework-yaml\n  - django-cors-headers\n  - django-debug-toolbar\n  - django-plugins\n  - defusedxml\n  - geojson\n  - markdown\n  - mkdocs\n  - mkdocs-bootswatch\n\n\n\n\n... can be used to create the environment (save as file \n\njane_anaconda_env.txt\n):\n\n\n$ conda config --add channels obspy\n$ conda env create -n jane -f jane_anaconda_env.txt\n\n\n\n\nIt is a good idea to pin the version of those packages that \nJane\n depends on \nin a certain version (to avoid accidental updates). To do so put the following\ncontent in a new file \n/path/to/anaconda/envs/jane/conda-meta/pinned\n (see\n\nhttp://conda.pydata.org/docs/faq.html#pinning-packages\n):\n\n\npython 3.4.*\nobspy 1.0.*\n\n\n\n\nAfter everything has been installed, make sure to run the tests as explained\n\non the testing page\n to make sure the installation is valid.\n\n\nPostgreSQL Setup\n\n\nPostgreSQL should also be run as a service via whatever mechanism your\noperating system requires. It is also good practice to run PostgreSQL as\nanother non-root user to minimize the attack surface. The database name, user,\nand password can of course be changed and be configured within \nJane\n.\n\n\nIf you don't run PostgreSQL as a service (\nDO NOT DO THIS IN PRODUCTION\n),\nyou can initalize and start it with:\n\n\n$ initdb -D /path/to/db\n$ postgres -D /path/to/db\n\n# All the following commands will have to be executed in a separate shell.\n$ createuser --superuser postgres  # required for pgadmin\n\n\n\n\nJane\n needs a database to work with. Here we will create a new database user\n\njane\n and a new database also called \njane\n. You are free to choose the names\nhowever you see fit, just make sure they are the same as in your \n\nlocal_settings.py\n file.\n\n\n$ createuser --encrypted --pwprompt jane\n$ createdb --owner=jane jane\n\n\n\n\nThe last step is to enable the PostGIS extension for the just created database.\n\n\n$ psql --command=\nCREATE EXTENSION postgis;\n jane\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Jane\n\n\ncd /path/where/jane/should/live\ngit clone https://github.com/krischer/jane.git\ncd jane\n\n\n\n\nAdapt Local Settings\n\n\nCopy \njane/src/local_settings.py.example\n to \njane/src/local_settings.py\n and \nfill in the database and user name and credentials. Also have a look at the\n\navailable settings\n to customize your \nJane\n installation.\n\n\nInitialize Django Database\n\n\nThis command will setup all necessary tables and what not. All \n\npython manage.py\n commands have to be executed in the \njane/src\n folder or \nuse an absolute path to the \nmanage.py\n file.\n\n\n$ python manage.py migrate\n$ python manage.py createsuperuser\n\n\n\n\nRun Jane\n\n\nTo test the setup, run \nJane\n with ...\n\n\n$ python manage.py runserver\n\n\n\n\n... which will launch a local web server.\n\n\nBuilding the Documentation\n\n\nAssuming \nmkdocs\n has been installed as above:\n\n\ncd /path/to/jane/docs\n./build_docs.sh\n\n\n\n\nthis will build and copy the build files to the correct directory.\n\n\nInstalling on a Production Server\n\n\nThings are very similar on a production server but you want to run most \nthings as services and of course the availability of all these service must be \nmonitored and security critical updates have to be applied to maintain a stable \ninstallation. Make sure to speak about this with your admin! We take no \nresponsibilities for any security problems.\n\n\nProperly deploying a Django application is well documented in the \n\nofficial Django documentation\n.\n\n\nThe fellowing is a shortened introduction on how to deploy it on a Debian \nserver with an Apache webserver. Please note that \nmod-wsgi-py3\n for the \nApache web server has to be the same Python with which \nJane\n is run, so \nusing the Anaconda Python is likely quite hard to do.\n\n\nPostgreSQL\n\n\nInstall with\n\n\nsudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib\n\n\n\n\nmake sure to get at least version 9.4. Then perform the basic setup (you \nmust run this as the \npostgres\n user or whatever user PostgreSQL has been \nconfigured with):\n\n\ncreateuser --encrypted --pwprompt jane\ncreatedb --owner=jane jane\npsql --command=\nCREATE EXTENSION postgis;\n jane\n\n\n\n\nPython and Dependencies\n\n\nWe (as much as possible) rely on Debian packages. Sometimes we have to use \n\npip\n if the Python module is not packaged. Make sure to install Python 3.4!\n\n\nFirst, add the ObsPy sources as written \n\nhere\n.\n\n\nThen install as much as possible with \napt-get\n:\n\n\n# AS ROOT!\napt-get install python3-psycopg2 \\\n    python3-markdown \\\n    python3-yaml \\\n    python3-defusedxml \\\n    python3-gdal \\\n    python3-flake8 \\\n    python3-pip \\\n    python3-obspy \\\n    ipython3 \\\n    git\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally some things as a local user. You will likely want to create a \nseparate user to run \nJane\n. With that user, run (note that you might have \nto use \npip3\n instead of \npip\n):\n\n\n# AS USER!\npip3 install --user \\\n    \ndjango\n=1.9,\n1.10\n \\\n    djangorestframework \\\n    djangorestframework-gis \\\n    djangorestframework-jsonp \\\n    djangorestframework-xml \\\n    djangorestframework-yaml \\\n    django-cors-headers \\\n    django-debug-toolbar \\\n    django-plugins \\\n    geojson \\\n    mkdocs \\\n    mkdocs-bootswatch\n\n\n\n\nThen follow the instructions above to get \nJane\n from Github, adapt the \n\nlocal_settings.py\n file, and build the documentation.\n\n\nFinally also run a couple of \nmanage.py\n commands (you might have to use \n\npython3\n). The \ncollectstatic\n command will copy all static files to a \ncommon directory that is then served directly by Apache making it much faster:\n\n\ncd jane/src\npython3 manage.py migrate\npython3 manage.py createsuperuser\npython3 manage.py collectstatic\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Apache\n\n\nThe last thing to do is to configure Apache to run \nJane\n over the \nWSGI\n.\n\n\nInstall it with\n\n\nsudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3\nsudo a2enmod wsgi\n\n\n\n\nmake sure its running\n\n\n/etc/init.d/apache2 status\n\n\n\n\nThe \nVirtualHost\n configuration has to look approximately like this (details \nwill of course differ per installation):\n\n\nVirtualHost *:80\n\n        WSGIDaemonProcess jane user=jane \n        python-path=/path/to/jane/jane/src:/path/to/site-packages processes=4 threads=8\n        WSGIProcessGroup jane\n        WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/jane/jane/src/jane/wsgi.py\n        WSGIPassAuthorization On\n        WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}\n\n        \nDirectory /path/to/jane/jane/src/jane\n\n                \nFiles wsgi.py\n\n                Require all granted\n                \n/Files\n\n        \n/Directory\n\n\n        # Prevent django from serving static files\n        DocumentRoot /path/to/jane/jane/static\n        Alias /static /path/to/jane/jane/static\n        \nDirectory /path/to/jane/jane/static\n\n                Require all granted\n        \n/Directory\n\n\n        ...\n\n\n/VirtualHost\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to choose sensible \nprocesses\n and \nthreads\n options.",

            "text": "REST Interface\n\n\nJane's REST interface can be used to query documents defined by plug-ins and\nassociated indices and attachments. By default Jane ships with StationXML and\nQuakeML plug-ins but users can easily add their own. Additionally the REST\ninterface offers access to waveform data on a per-trace basis but this is\nlikely less useful than Jane's FDSNWS dataselect service which serves the same\ndata with a more convenient interface.\n\n\nIn the following \nJANE_ROOT\n will be used to denote the root address of a\nrunning Jane server. The REST interface can then be accessed at\n\nJANE_ROOT/rest\n.\n\n\nGeneral Remarks\n\n\nSupported Data Formats\n\n\nThe data in the REST interface can mostly be queried in different formats -\nchoose whichever suites you best. If accessed from a web browser, a nice HTML\nview will be served; otherwise it will default to \nJSON\n output. The \nformat\n\nargument can be used to request the data in different formats:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n\nURL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON\n\n\nJANE_ROOT/rest/something?format=json\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXML\n\n\nJANE_ROOT/rest/something?format=xml\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYAML\n\n\nJANE_ROOT/rest/something?format=yaml\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\nJANE_ROOT/rest/something?format=jsonp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForce the HTML API view\n\n\nJANE_ROOT/rest/something?format=api\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPagination\n\n\nData in the REST interface is paginated, meaning that only a certain amount of\nthe available data is returned at any point. It can be controlled with two\nquery parameters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlimit\n\n\nControls the number of returned records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\noffset\n\n\nSkip the given number of records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following URL for example will return records number 200 to 299:\n\nJANE_ROOT/rest/something?limit=100\noffset=200\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMany actions and data require certain permissions, thus users have to\nauthenticate themselves. Within the HTML web API view, Django's sessions\nauthentication can be used; there is a nice button to log-in at the top right.\nAnother way to authenticate yourself is to use HTTP Basic authentication. For\nall examples on this page we will assume a user named \nuser\n with \npw\n as a\npassword. Furthermore we will illustrate all examples with code snippets for\nthe Python \nrequests\n library, for\n\nHTTPie\n, a user-friendly command line client, and good ol'\n\ncurl\n itself.\n\n\nExample using the Python \nrequests\n library:\n\n\nimport request\nr = request.get(url=\nJANE_ROOT/rest/...\n, auth=(\nuser\n, \npw\n))\n\n\n\n\nExample using the \nHTTPie\n CLI client:\n\n\n$ http -a user:pw JANE_ROOT/rest/...\n\n\n\n\nExample using \ncurl\n:\n\n\n$ curl --user user:pw JANE_ROOT/rest/...\n\n\n\n\nHTTP Methods and Headers\n\n\nDepending on the desired action, you might have to send the request with a\ndifferent HTTP method or additional headers. This section is a short tutorial\non how to do this.\n\n\nExample using the Python \nrequests\n library:\n\n\nimport request\n\nheaders = {\ncategory\n: \nsomething\n}\n\nr = request.get(\nJANE_ROOT/rest/...\n, headers=headers)\nr = request.put(\nJANE_ROOT/rest/...\n, headers=headers)\nr = request.post(\nJANE_ROOT/rest/...\n, headers=headers)\nr = request.delete(\nJANE_ROOT/rest/...\n, headers=headers)\n\n\n\n\nExample using the \nHTTPie\n CLI client:\n\n\n$ http JANE_ROOT/rest/... 'category:something'\n$ http PUT JANE_ROOT/rest/... 'category:something'\n$ http POST JANE_ROOT/rest/... 'category:something'\n$ http DELETE JANE_ROOT/rest/... 'category:something'\n\n\n\n\nExample using \ncurl\n:\n\n\n$ curl -H 'category: something' JANE_ROOT/rest/...\n$ curl -X PUT -H 'category: something' JANE_ROOT/rest/...\n$ curl -X POST -H 'category: something' JANE_ROOT/rest/...\n$ curl -X DELETE -H 'category: something' JANE_ROOT/rest/...\n\n\n\n\nAPI Endpoints\n\n\nThis section presents a quick overview of all available endpoints including the\nacceptable HTTP methods for each; they are explained in more detail further\ndown this page. Jane's REST API at points behaves a bit different from other\nREST APIs: it might not offer a certain method or interpret it slightly\ndifferent. This is on purpose to provide as natural an API as possible tailored\nto the capabilities of Jane.\n\n\nGeneral Endpoints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndpoint\n\n\nAvailable Methods\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJANE_ROOT/rest\n\n\nGET\n\n\nRoot of the REST interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaveform Endpoints\n\n\nAll endpoints related to the waveform database of Jane. \nID\n is the id of a\nparticular waveform trace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndpoint\n\n\nAvailable Methods\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJANE_ROOT/rest/waveforms\n\n\nGET\n\n\nList of all waveforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJANE_ROOT/rest/waveforms/ID\n\n\nGET\n\n\nREST resource for a particular waveform trace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJANE_ROOT/rest/waveforms/ID/plot\n\n\nGET\n\n\nPlot of that trace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJANE_ROOT/rest/waveforms/ID/file\n\n\nGET\n\n\nData containing that trace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument Endpoints\n\n\nEndpoints for the documents sorted by document type which is defined by the\nplug-ins.

In the future it might evolve to do some different things so there\ncurrently is not much more to say to this.\n\n\nDocuments\n\n\nThe \nJANE_ROOT/rest/documents\n route is the entry point to the actual files on\nwhich Jane's document database is built around.\n\n\nList View\n\n\nTo get a list of all available documents of a certain document type, send, e.g.\n\n\nGET JANE_ROOT/rest/documents/stationxml\n\n\n\n\nDocument View\n\n\nDocuments are identified via filename, which thus has to be unique per document\ntype.\n\n\nGET JANE_ROOT/rest/documents/stationxml/BW.FURT.xml\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n\nThe REST API shows some information for each file, to download the actual file, do, e.g.\n\n\nGET JANE_ROOT/rest/documents/stationxml/BW.FURT.xml/data\n\n\n\n\nAdd New Document\n\n\nTo create a new document, send a \nPUT\n request to a certain document URL, e.g.\n\n\nPUT JANE_ROOT/rest/documents/stationxml/BW.FURT.xml\n\n\n\n\nLet's say you want to upload the file \nBW.FURT.xml\n.\n\n\nExample using the Python \nrequests\n library:\n\n\nimport request\n\nwith open(\nBW.FURT.xml\n, \nrb\n) as fh:\n    r = requests.put(\n        url=\nJANE_ROOT/rest/documents/stationxml/BW.FURT.xml\n,\n        auth=(\nuser\n, \npw\n),\n        data=fh)\n\nassert r.ok\n\n\n\n\nExample using the \nHTTPie\n CLI client:\n\n\n$ http -a user:pw PUT \nJANE_ROOT/rest/documents/stationxml/BF.FURT.xml\n \n BW.FURT.xml\n\n\n\n\nExample using \ncurl\n:\n\n\n$ curl --user user:pw \\\n  --data-binary @BW.FURT.XML \\\n  -X PUT \nJANE_ROOT/rest/documents/stationxml/BF.FURT.xml\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete a Document\n\n\nTo delete a document, just send a \nDELETE\n request. Please keep in mind that\nthis will also delete all indices and potential attachments of the document.\nThe attachments might not be restorable if you have no backup.\n\n\nDELETE JANE_ROOT/rest/documents/stationxml/BW.FURT.xml\n\n\n\n\nExample using the Python \nrequests\n library:\n\n\nimport request\n\nr = requests.delete(\n    url=\nJANE_ROOT/rest/documents/stationxml/BW.FURT.xml\n,\n    auth=(\nuser\n, \npw\n))\n\nassert r.ok\n\n\n\n\nExample using the \nHTTPie\n CLI client:\n\n\n$ http -a user:pw DELETE \nJANE_ROOT/rest/documents/stationxml/BF.FURT.xml\n\n\n\n\n\nExample using \ncurl\n:\n\n\n$ curl --user user:pw \\\n  -X DELETE \nJANE_ROOT/rest/documents/stationxml/BF.FURT.xml\n\n\n\n\n\nModify Existing Document\n\n\nTo modify an existing document, first delete it and then create a new one with\nthe same name. This is to safe-guard against accidentally overwriting exiting\ndocuments including attachments.\n\n\nDocument Indices\n\n\nThe \nJANE_ROOT/rest/document_indices\n route is the entry point to the indices,\n    the core of Jane's document database.\n\n\nList View\n\n\nTo get a list of all available indices of a certain document type, send, e.g.\n\n\nGET JANE_ROOT/rest/document_indices/stationxml\n\n\n\n\nSearching Over the Indices\n\n\nNow the special thing here is that you can search over these indices and only\nget a subset of indices that match your query. The keys that can be searched\nover are determined by the \nmeta\n attribute of the indexer plug-in for that\nparticular document type. In the case of the StationXML plugin it is defined as\n\n\nmeta = {\n    \nnetwork\n: \nstr\n,\n    \nstation\n: \nstr\n,\n    \nlocation\n: \nstr\n,\n    \nchannel\n: \nstr\n,\n    \nlatitude\n: \nfloat\n,\n    \nlongitude\n: \nfloat\n,\n    \nelevation_in_m\n: \nfloat\n,\n    \ndepth_in_m\n: \nfloat\n,\n    \nstart_date\n: \nUTCDateTime\n,\n    \nend_date\n: \nUTCDateTime\n,\n    \nsample_rate\n: \nfloat\n,\n    \nsensor_type\n: \nstr\n}\n\n\n\n\nIt is necessary to define this, as the available queries depend on the data\ntype. There are 5 possible data types: \n\"str\"\n, \n\"int\"\n, \n\"float\"\n, \n\"bool\"\n,\nand \n\"UTCDateTime\"\n. Search parameters are appended to the URL and the type\nof the parameters determines the available queries. Any number of them can\nbe combined. Identity queries can be negated by prefixing with an\nexclamation mark. Furthermore as soon as you query a parameter and it is\n\nnull\n for a certain document, that document will not be returned even for\ninequality queries.\n\n\nStrings\n\n\nStrings can be searched based on (in)equality.

All indexed waveforms can be queried \nwith it. It can be found at \nJANE_ROOT/fdsnws/dataselect/1/\n and used with \nany of the common tools.\n\n\nA very convenient tool it the FDSN web service client of the\n\nObsPy\n library \n(\ndocumentation\n), \nusage example with \nJane\n:\n\n\n import obspy\n\n from obspy.clients.fdsn import Client\n\n c = Client(\nhttp://JANE_ROOT\n)\n\n st = c.get.get_waveforms(\n...     network=\nBW\n, station=\nRJOB\n, location=\n, channel=\nBHZ\n, \n...     starttime=obspy.UTCDateTime(2016, 1, 1, 3, 0, 5),\n...     endtime=obspy.UTCDateTime(2016, 1, 1, 5, 0, 5))\n\n\n\n\nWaveform REST Interface\n\n\nWaveforms can also be retrieved via the REST interface, found at \n\nJANE_ROOT/rest/waveforms\n. In most cases the fdsnws service will be more \nconvenient but the REST interface exists if somebody needs it. It should be \nfairly self-explanatory.\n\n\n\n\nRestrictions/Protected Stations\n\n\nBy default all waveform data is public, i.e. anybody with access to the \nJane\n\nHTTP server can query all data. It is possible to limit access at a \nper-station granularity. To do that, add a new restriction in the admin \ninterface. As soon as a restriction has been added it will be considered \nprotected and only users that are part of the restriction will still be able\nto access them.\n\n\n\n\nTo access the data, users will have to use the \nqueryauth\n route of the \nfdsnws \ndataselect\n service. Usage example with \nObsPy\n:\n\n\n import obspy\n\n from obspy.clients.fdsn import Client\n\n c = Client(\nhttp://JANE_ROOT\n, user=\nlion\n, password=\nmyfavoritepw\n)\n\n st = c.get.get_waveforms(\n...     network=\nBW\n, station=\nRJOB\n, location=\n, channel=\nBHZ\n, \n...     starttime=obspy.UTCDateTime(2016, 1, 1, 3, 0, 5),\n...     endtime=obspy.UTCDateTime(2016, 1, 1, 5, 0, 5))\n\n\n\n\nWaveform Mappings\n\n\nSome data, especially temporary deployments, might have different network,\nstation, location, and/or channel codes than you would like them to have.\nWaveform mappings to the rescue! Add a mapping by using the admin interface:\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen it maps a network, station, location, channel tuple to a new\none, valid across a certain time range. Additionally, to solve the tricky\ncases, each mapping takes a regular expression for its path on the filesystem.\nThe default value simply matches all paths. Be careful to not define\noverlapping mappings - it will cause errors during the waveform indexing\nprocess. \nJane\n has some checks in place to prevent that but in cases\ninvolving different regular expressions for the paths it cannot tell.\n\n\nIf you have a large number of mappings to apply, consider using the \n\nadd_documents\n management command as documented \n\nhere\n.\n\n\nAny freshly added mapping will be automatically applied to newly indexed\ndata. To also apply it to existing data, press the \nUPDATE WAVEFORM INDICES\nWITH MAPPINGS (SLOW!)\n button in the mappings panel in the admin interface:\n\n\n\n\nThis might take a while for big databases.",

A very convenient tool it the FDSN web service client of the ObsPy  library \n( documentation ), \nusage example with  Jane :   import obspy  from obspy.clients.fdsn import Client  c = Client( http://JANE_ROOT )  st = c.get.get_waveforms(\n...     network= BW , station= RJOB , location= , channel= BHZ , \n...     starttime=obspy.UTCDateTime(2016, 1, 1, 3, 0, 5),\n...     endtime=obspy.UTCDateTime(2016, 1, 1, 5, 0, 5))",

Add a mapping by using the admin interface:   As can be seen it maps a network, station, location, channel tuple to a new\none, valid across a certain time range. Additionally, to solve the tricky\ncases, each mapping takes a regular expression for its path on the filesystem.\nThe default value simply matches all paths. Be careful to not define\noverlapping mappings - it will cause errors during the waveform indexing\nprocess.  Jane  has some checks in place to prevent that but in cases\ninvolving different regular expressions for the paths it cannot tell.  If you have a large number of mappings to apply, consider using the  add_documents  management command as documented  here .  Any freshly added mapping will be automatically applied to newly indexed\ndata.
